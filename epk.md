## BiOGRAPHY

The New York Times has compared Vert’s music to John Cage; Boomkat has compared it to Robbie Williams. It sounds like neither.

Starting with THE KÖLN KONZERT in 1999, Adam Butler a/k/a Vert has released 6 varied albums on labels such as Sonig and Thrill Jockey, which have appeared on end-of-year best-of lists in Pitchfork, The Wire, Spex, among others. He has toured throughout Europe, the US and Asia, either on his own, or supporting bands such as Mouse on Mars and Tortoise.

His latest album, THE DAYS WiTHiN, was released on Shitkatapult in November 2015. It received many positive reviews (see below). He has formed a touring band with Taylor Savvy (Peaches/Gonzales/solo) on double bass and Andrea Belfi (David Grubbs/Mike Watt/solo) on drums, although he also plays solo shows.

At the age of 6, Adam Butler started his musical career with his first piano lessons. At the age of 13 he swapped the piano for the electric guitar. At the age of 20, after a night taking acid he was found outside the local music shop at opening time, wanting to swap his guitar for a sampler. At the age of 24, ankle damage forced him to stop skateboarding, and he became Vert.

Along with Milky Boy and Animals on Wheels, he started the label Bovinyl, but after releasing 4 12”s (including Vert's BROKEN BREAKBEAT BEBOP), they quietly faded away, assuming that the world just didn't care. But the world did, in fact, care, and shortly afterwards Animals on Wheels signed to Ninja Tune, while Mouse on Mars contacted Vert and he signed to their new label Sonig.

He then released 3 albums of intricated instrumental electronica, including the acclaimed THE KÖLN KONZERT, a sample-free bastardpopisation of the original jazz classic.

After a crippling studio burglary in 2004, he produced SOME BEANS & AN OCTOPUS (Sonig, October 2006), in cahoots with musicians such as rapper Noah 23, guitarist Noël Akchoté, turntablist DJ Elephant Power and a mysterious Serbian double bassist.

Born in the UK, Butler moved to Cologne in 2001, New York in 2007, and Berlin in 2010.

## REViEWS FOR THE DAYS WiTHiN

> “Ein Geniestreich aus dem Geisterhaus des Pop: Adam Butler führt Melodie und Geräusch im melancholischen Song-Gewebe wie selbstverständlich zusammen.”
**MUSiK EXPRESS**

**SOUNDCHECK / RADiO EiNS** Wertung: 2 x Hit. 2 x geht in Ordnung

> “Butler, der jetzt sein neues Album unter dem Künstlernamen Vert veröffentlicht hat, klingt ganz so, als habe der mittlere [Tom] Waits einen Sampler und einen Computer geschenkt bekommen.”
**DiE ZEiT**

> ”bis [zur Ende] hat »The Days Within« die Wahrnehmung eh schon dreimal kräftig durchgepustet.”
**INTRO**

Berliner Tonträger der Woche in **ZiTTY**
