EVERYONE i MEET iS LOOKiNG FOR A MOMENT’S SHELTER FROM THE GLARE OF ALL THE POSSiBLE WORLDS RUNNiNG ALONGSiDE WHAT iS THERE. (DO YOU SEE THEM TOO?) EVERYTHiNG YOU CAN THiNK OF HAS ALREADY HAPPENED & iT’S ALL HAPPENiNG OVER & OVER & OVER & OVER AGAiN. iN ONE WORLD EVERYONE KNOWS THEiR OWN MiND, & NO-ONE HESiTATES & THERE’S NO DOUBT. iN ONE WORLD ELECTRiCiTY iS TiME, & NO-ONE EVER DiES THEY JUST FADE OUT. (WOULD YOU FADE WiTH ME?) EVERYTHiNG YOU CAN THiNK OF HAS ALREADY HAPPENED & iT’S ALL HAPPENiNG OVER & OVER & OVER & OVER AGAiN. REGRET WAS A WRiTER, WROTE HER NAME ON BUiLDiNGS, WALLS & TRAiNS; A STARFiSH WiTH A TEAR WAS HER SiGN. SHE ONLY WORKED  BY NiGHT & NOT A SOUL HAD EVER SEEN HER FACE, BUT PEOPLE CLAiMED THEY’D SEEN HER MANY TiMES MOVE THROUGH THEiR DREAMS. SOMEONE STARTED UP A SiTE CALLED METAPHYSiCAL GRAFFiTi SHOWiNG PHOTOS  OF HER WORKS THAT PEOPLE FOUND. ONE DAY A POSTER CLAiMED THAT HE’D UNEARTHED REGRET’S REAL iDENTiTY; THAT NiGHT THE SiTE’S WHOLE SERVER FARM BURNED DOWN — NO-ONE KNEW HOW. i THOUGHT i SAW HER ONCE ON STREET ViEW, SHE WAS WRiTiNG WiTH A DEEP BLUE MOP ACROSS SOME SACRED DESERT PiECE OF WALL. THERE’S SOMETHiNG ABOUT HER WHERE YOU START TO THiNK SHE’S EVERYWHERE — BUT UBiQUiTY’S JUST THE SAME AS NOT BEiNG AT ALL. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WALLS? WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TRAiNS & TEARS? WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT STARFiSH ANYWAY? BECAUSE OBJECTS ALL WiTHDRAW, & MAYBE SHE WAS NEVER THERE. MAYBE THAT BURNED DOWN SERVER FARM iS ALL THERE’S EVER BEEN. TELL ME iS THE NEVER TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY DiFFERENT TO THE NEVER WAS? AND TELL ME WHiLE YOU’RE AT iT WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU STARE AT 0S & 1S. THERE’S A BEAR iN THE HALL & AN OLD BEACH BALL & A BULB iLLUMiNATES ALL YOUR THOUGHTS. BUT THE BEACH BALL’S HALF-DEF-LATED & THE BULB iT JUST FADES iN THE SUN. AND THEN WE ALL FALL DOWN. PiLE UP ALL YOUR DREAMS iN THE YARD & WE’LL TORCH THEM: ONEiRiC DESiRE. AND WE’LL LAUGH & SiNG & CRY WHiLE THE SMOKE & SPARKS ALL SPiRAL TO THE SKY. THEN i’LL TELL YOU MY FAVOURiTE LiES WHiLE THE EMBERS FADE & EXPiRE, & WE’LL CROUCH & WAiT FOR SUNRiSE iN THE HOPE THAT THE END iS NiGH. SO WE CAN ALL FALL DOWN. SO PLEASE TELL ME iF THE NEVER-TO-BE iS FUNDAMENTALLY DiFFERENT TO THE NEVER WAS. iF YOU BREAK LiTTLE PROMiSES, SOONER OR LATER YOU’RE GOiNG TO BREAK THE BiG ONES. THERE’S A PiANO ON FiRE & A MAN ON THE WiRE & HE’S TRYiNG TO TREAD ALL YOUR THOUGHTS, WHiLE THE BEAR SLUMPS iN THE CORNER, & THE 0S ELiMiNATE ALL THE 1S. AND THEN WE’LL ALL FALL DOWN. i START THE DAY WiTH BALLANTiNE’S & i END iT WiTH CAFFEiNE, iN THESE DAYS OF GOiNG BACKWARDS, DON’T KNOW WHO TO BELiEVE. iF YOU WANT CLARiFiCATiON BETTER STAY AT HOME & COWER, COZ DiSCOMBOBULATiON iS MY SECRET SPECiAL POWER. i’LL REARRANGE GEOMETRY, i’LL MAKE ACUTE OBTUSE, & i OFFER NOW APOLOGiES iF MY WORK SEEMS TOO DiFFUSE. SO iF YOU WANT ASSiSTANCE, CAN AFFORD MY DAiLY RATES JUST PLACE AN ADVERT iN THE USUAL PUBLiCATiONS & JUST WAiT, i RUN THE WAVES. i’VE BROUGHT DOWN SERVERS iN CONNECTiCUT WiTH A FEW WELL-PLACED COMMANDS, i’VE BROUGHT BACK GOVERNMENTS FROM EXiLE, CONFUSED BANDiTS & BRiGANDS. i TREKKED FOR DAYS ACROSS THE DESERT TO SEE THE KiRGHiZ LiGHT. i’VE iNVENTED ALPHABETS THAT MUTATE AS YOU WRiTE. YES THERE ARE POWERFUL GROUPS iN PARiS WHO DON’T BELiEVE THAT i EXiST, THEY SAY THEY NEVER SEE ME TRAVEL, BUT THE REASON FOR THAT iS THAT i ALWAYS MOVE BY NiGHT AND ONLY THEN BY LAND & SEA, COZ iF MAN WAS MEANT TO FLY THEN HE’D HAVE HOLLOW BONES & TEETH, i RUN THE WAVES. ENDLESS SiMULATiONS & MUMBLED iNViTATiONS; THE MiSTAKES ARE ALL PART OF MY PLAN. AND i’M PATiENT ON THE PAVEMENT, LOST iN CHEWiNG GUM CONSTELLATiONS, WiTH A FADiNG STREET MAP FOR THE WRONG TOWN. i LOST MY WAY ONCE OR TWiCE BUT THE WAY CAME BACK TO FiND ME ONCE OR TWiCE OR MAYBE MAYBE MORE. AND A WATCH WiLL GET YOU NOWHERE COZ iT JUST GOES ROUND iN CiRCLES, THAT’S WHY i LEFT MiNE LYiNG NEXT TO YOURS. BUT i JUST DON’T KNOW HOW YOU MADE ALL THiS LiGHT. AND i WONDER, WHAT DOES iT MEAN, ALL THiS LiGHT? i GREW UP WHEN i REALiSED EVERY TOWN iS MUCH THE SAME: EVERY STOP i GLiMPSE FROM EVERY TRAiN. AND THE NEON SiGNS iNTONE THEiR MESSAGES OF LONELiNESS OVER & OVER & OVER & OVER AGAiN. SO iT’S ENDLESS REPETiTiON, THE SPRiNG WiTHiN THE SPRiNG: THE MONTHS WiTHOUT AND THE DAYS WiTHiN. AND THE MOON’S iN ON iT TOO WiTH iTS PHASES AND iTS MOODS, AND iTS WHOLE NEW OLD NEW OLD NEW OLD THiNG. BUT i STiLL DON’T KNOW HOW YOU MADE ALL THiS LiGHT. AND i WONDER, WHERE DOES iT COME FROM, THiS BLiNDiNG WHiTE SNOWSTORM OF LiGHT? i WiSH THAT i COULD TELL YOU THAT THE SKY WAS BLACK AS CROWS, THAT THUNDER ROLLED AS THE CiTY WAiLED & CRiED; THAT SUNLiGHT BLEACHED DiAGONALS THROUGH THE SEA OF DUST THAT ROSE iN THE FLAT UPSTAiRS WHEN OLD MAN EMBERS DiED; OR THAT PLANES FELL FROM THE SKY & ROUTERS CRASHED — LiNES WENT DEAD WHiLE CURRENCiES ALL DiVED; OR THAT THE AiR WAS FiLLED WiTH HARMONiES THAT SPARKLED AS THEY SANG, WHiLE COMMUTERS STARED ALL TEARFUL & TONGUE-TiED; OR THAT MOURNERS THRONGED THE STREETS & BRASS BANDS PLAYED, WHiLE ON EVERY CORNER BALD MEN EULOGiSED; & FiNELY WROUGHT OBiTUARiES FiLLED EVERY FRONT PAGE… i COULD TELL YOU THAT BUT i WOULD HAVE TO LiE. EMBERS WAS THE KiND OF MAN WHO’D LOOK YOU iN THE EYE AS HE TEASED OUT ALL YOUR DAYDREAMS & BELiEFS. THEY’D CRAWL OUT OF YOUR MOUTH LiKE A TAPEWORM THAT’S BEEN STARVED & THEN TEMPTED BY THE SMELL OF FRESH RAW BEEF. HE ONCE TOLD ME WiTH A SMiRK THAT HE’D BEEN A PASTRY CHEF, HE SAiD THE PRiNCE OF DANiSH — THAT WAS ME. BUT THEN ANOTHER TiME HE TOLD ME THAT HE WASN’T SCARED OF DEATH BECAUSE HE’D SPENT HiS WHOLE LiFETiME ON HiS KNEES. LiKE A ROSE iN WiNTER, LiKE A DRUNK AT DAWN, ENTHRALLED BY THE MORNiNG’S ROUGH GLEAM; LiKE AN UNKNOWN SCENE FROM AN UNKNOWN PLAY, i WiLL WORK MY WAY YOUR DREAMS. AND THEN ONCE i’M THERE i WiLL TEACH YOU THiNGS, EXTiNCTiONS OF FEELiNGS YOU KNEW. i WiLL WEAR THEM THROUGH & REPLACE THEM ALL WiTH A NEW SET OF MUTATED THOUGHTS. AND THEN YOU & i CAN COLLECT OUR THiNGS & FLY TO THiS ViLLA i KNOW. AND THEN i WiLL SHOW YOU ALL THE SCENES THAT WERE CUT FROM YOUR FOLiO. GUESS iT’S TRUE WHAT THEY SOMETiMES SAY THAT A LiTTLE LEARNiNG iS A DANGEROUS THiNG. AT LEAST THAT’S HOW iT SEEMS TO ME NOW AFTER YEARS OF HiDiNG FROM EVERYTHiNG. i WAS SHANGHAiED iN THE PRiME OF MY LiFE, TAKEN DOWN UNDERGROUND WHERE THE TERMiTES RUN. iT WAS THERE SHE SEDUCED ME WiTH iDEOLOGY — THE PROMiSE OF KNOWLEDGE & THE SALT TASTE OF HER TONGUE. iT SEEMED TO ME THEN THAT iT ALL MADE SENSE, AS THE WEEKS TURNED TO YEARS & THE WORDS TURNED TO DEEDS, TiLL ONE DAY ON THE NEWS, A FACE i BARELY STiLL KNEW; EARS FULL OF RiNGiNG & A HOLE WHERE CERTAiNTY USED TO BE. HE DOWNSiZED HiS AMBiTiON TO PRACTiCALLY NOTHiNG, TOOK A ROOM ABOVE A MiSSiON, TOLD HiMSELF THAT HE WAS LUCKY. THE KiDS FROM THE NEiGHBOURHOOD WOULD BRiNG HiM BROKEN LiGHTBULBS & HE’D HANG THEM FROM THE CEiLiNG. “ONE FOR EVERY MONTH SHE’S BEEN AWAY,” HE SAiD, “ONE FOR EVERY MONTH SHE’S BEEN GONE.” HE SPENT HiS DAYS & NiGHTS WORKiNG ON A WATCH THAT WAS SENSiTiSED TO ECSTASY & LOSS. iT WOULD SLOW DOWN TO A CRAWL, MAKE BLiSSFUL MOMENTS LAST ALL DAY; SADNESS WOULD SPEED iT, BAD DAYS WENT BY iN THE BLiNK OF AN EYE (& EVERY TiME HE BLiNKED A MONTH WOULD GO BY). AND SO HE DECLARED HiS iNDEPENDENCE FROM TiME. HE WiTHDREW FROM iTS GLARE, HE THOUGHT HE’D PUT HiMSELF ON STANDBY. BUT iT’S ALWAYS RUSH HOUR SOMEWHERE… ONE TUESDAY AFTERNOON iN THE MiDDLE OF THE DOG DAYS SOMEONE KNOCKED ON HiS DOOR, NO-ONE CAUGHT SiGHT OF HER FACE. LATER ON NO-ONE COULD TELL iF iT WAS HiM OR HER THAT SCREAMED, BUT THE FLASH OF A THOUSAND LiGHTBULBS BLiNDED EVERYONE WHO’D BEEN OUTSiDE THAT DAY. AND NEiTHER ONE OF THEM WAS EVER SEEN AGAiN. EVERYONE i MEET iS LOOKiNG FOR A MOMENT’S SHELTER FROM THE GLARE OF ALL THE POSSiBLE WORLDS RUNNiNG ALONGSiDE WHAT iS THERE. (DO YOU SEE THEM TOO?)
